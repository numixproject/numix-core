Numix uTouch icon theme
==============
Numix uTouch is an icon theme from the [Numix project](http://numixproject.org). This theme is on a form of LTS - it will not receive updates anywhere as frequently as Circle or Square (which we recommend you use) but it will still receive the occasional update to keep it up to date. This is only because the theme still seems to be popular with the community and as soon as community interest drops the theme will be axed.

Licensed under the GPL-3.0+

### Installation

If you still want to use uTouch on Ubuntu or any of it's derivatives (including Mint and elementary OS) you can use our Numix PPA. Fire up a Terminal and run the following:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:numix/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install numix-icon-theme-utouch
```

### Icon Requests
Because of a restructure, icon requests are not currently available. 

### Hardcoded Icons
To deal with hardcoded application icons Numix uses the [hardcode-fixer](https://github.com/Foggalong/hardcode-fixer) script. A list of the applications supported by the script that Numix also covers can be found [here](https://github.com/Foggalong/hardcode-fixer/blob/master/data/themes/numix.md).
