### Hardcoded Icons
To deal with hardcoded application icons Numix uses the [hardcode-fixer](https://github.com/Foggalong/hardcode-fixer) script. A list of the applications supported by the script can be found [here](https://github.com/Foggalong/hardcode-fixer/wiki/App-Support).


## Script

### Dependencies
The script needs Python 3.x to run. While the script can build themes for many platforms, running it is only officially supported on Linux. The exporting-to-PNG part of the script currently uses [Cairo](https://cairographics.org/) or [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/). The macOS packaging needs [libicns](http://icns.sourceforge.net/) for the `png2icns` command. More information can be found [in our wiki](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-core/wiki/Dependencies).

### How To Use
1. Download the repo
2. Run `gen.py --theme {square,circle} --platform {linux,osx,android}`
3. Get your generated package
