<!-- For Steam games we need the app ID that Steam uses to identify the game. Luckily these are easy to find, you can just search SteamDB and it's the very first entry on each page (for example, Team Fortress 2 is https://steamdb.info/app/440). If this game comes with DLC, demos, alternative version, etc which have distinct app IDs please list them here also since they'll have distinct launchers (e.g. 3900 & 3990 are both Civilization IV). -->
AppID: `STEAM_ID`
