about: Request an icon for a Windows app run through WINE, etc

<!-- IMPORTANT: we don't usually fulfill requests for Windows apps unless it's an obviously popular piece of software (e.g. Microsoft Word) or there's significant support behind the issue (usually 5+ people giving it a :+1:). That's partly because all apps run through WINE, Crossover, etc have hardcoded icons and partly because there are enough Linux, Android, and macOS apps to worry about without also worrying about Windows too. -->

<!-- Give the name of the app you would like an icon for and a link to its official website or source code. -->
App name: `APPLICATION_NAME`, `APP_WEBSITE`

<!-- Upload a screenshot or copy of the original icon the app used in its launcher. -->
